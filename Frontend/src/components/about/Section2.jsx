          Anchor is a developer community platform built to foster meaningful
          collaboration, continuous learning, and open-source innovation. We
          believe great ideas grow stronger when shared, and that no developer
          should have to solve problems alone. Whether you're debugging a
          stubborn 2AM error, preparing for your next hackathon, exploring a new
          framework, or contributing to open source, Anchor connects you with
          peers who are ready to build, learn, and grow alongside you. Our
          mission is simple: create a trusted space where developers can
          exchange knowledge, find teammates, solve real-world problems, and
          turn ambitious ideas into impactful projects — together.
